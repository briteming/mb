title: Explaining about the Clean Architecture
date: Apr 16, 2023
---

I've been tinkering with this website and the [Next.js 13 App Router](https://beta.nextjs.org) for a while now,
and it's been a great experience, especially in the last few months. But I've seen some confusion around
how to use the new features and React Server Components, so I wrote up an outline on building this website.

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  // The params to pre-render the page with.
  // Without this, the page will be rendered at runtime
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}
```

<img
  src="/posts/clean-architecture/resources/book.jpg"
  alt={
    "A screenshot of this blog with two code blocks stacked vertically. They look identical except that the bottom has a larger font size."
  }
  height={500}
/>

## Set up the project

First, we'll need to create a new Next.js project. You can launch the setup wizard with `npx create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app --experimental-app
```

### Sitemap support (`sitemap.js`)

See @leeerob's [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1639639575843729409) for more details.

```tsx
// app/sitemap.ts
import { getPosts } from "./lib/get-posts";

export default async function sitemap() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  const blogs = posts.map((post) => ({
    url: `https://maxleiter.com/blog/${post.slug}`,
    lastModified: new Date(post.lastModified).toISOString().split("T")[0],
  }));

  const routes = ["", "/about", "/blog", "/projects"].map((route) => ({
    url: `https://maxleiter.com${route}`,
    lastModified: new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0],
  }));

  return [...routes, ...blogs];
}
```

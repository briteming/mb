# Personal Blog

This is my personal blog using GitHub API to fetch issues as posts and repositories as projects. The blog is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Here I will be sharing my thoughts on various topics and my journey in the world of programming and technology. I will also be sharing my projects and experiences.
